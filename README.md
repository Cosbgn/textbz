# textbz
https://Text.bz Repo

This are just simple static files which redirect https://text.bz/NNNN to https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=NNNN because I was tired of typing all that each time.

It's static because I want to make sure it's always up and running as fast as possible and via CDN (i.e either Github Pages or Netlify)

For info just email me
